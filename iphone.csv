iphone,Flipkart Customer,5,Great product,"Damn such a great phone. Camera is really good, battery lasts long enough, super smooth even though its just 60 hz XDR display. Videos with action mode on are insanely stable and crisp.The night mode can take some really good shots jn low light conditions .The whole apple environment itself is so seamless.
