nokia,Flipkart Customer,4,Nice product,"This is a very good product, battery backup is satisfied me , touchpad is very soft and smooth .The one and only reason of good battery back up is there is no camera, wi-fi and  Bluetooth  connectivity option which is not a big issue.According to me it is a very good option  for calling purpose. I love this product for duel sim feature, good battery life and for its decent keypad."
